  If the `SourceWithCommentGenerator` class is used these comments will be

  Note that a node can only contain one comment. Subsequent calls to
  `add_comment` will ovverride the existing comments.

  Args:
    node: The AST node whose containing statement will be commented.
    text: A comment string.
    location: Where the comment should appear. Valid values are 'above',
    'below' and 'right'
